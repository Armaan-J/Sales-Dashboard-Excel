Sales Analysis Dashboard
This Excel project is a sales analysis dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of sales performance for a business. The dashboard is designed to display sales data such as date, gross profit, cost, and discount in an organized and user-friendly way, enabling users to easily monitor and track their sales performance.

Features
Data Visualization: The dashboard uses various charts and graphs to present sales data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner. The charts include line graphs, pie charts, and bar graphs that display data on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
Key Performance Indicators: The dashboard includes several key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into sales performance. These KPIs include gross profit margin, sales growth rate, and customer acquisition cost.
Filters and Pivot Tables: The dashboard includes filters and pivot tables that allow users to slice and dice their data in various ways to gain deeper insights into their sales performance. Users can filter data by product, region, or sales channel to identify trends and opportunities.
Dynamic Dashboard: The dashboard is designed to be dynamic, meaning that it automatically updates with new data inputs. Users can easily add new sales data to the dashboard, and the charts and graphs will update accordingly.
